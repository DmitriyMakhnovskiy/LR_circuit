Calculating all parameters of the LR circuit, including impedance, total current, power and power factor, and
compensation capacitor for its series or parallel connection.

The circuits, including 1-phae and 3-phase, were also simulated in LTspice (see the folder).

For more details on the power factor improvement refer to the report "Power factor improvement.pdf".
