For more details on the power factor improvement refer to the report "Power factor improvement.pdf".

In this project, we developed a Python-based tool designed to help students learn and calculate the essential parameters of single-phase LR circuits, including impedance, total current, power, power factor, and the compensation capacitor required for series or parallel configurations. The tool provides a clear and practical approach to understanding these fundamental concepts, ensuring that students can grasp the calculations involved in analysing LR circuits.

To broaden the scope of learning, LTspice simulations were used to model both single-phase and three-phase LR circuit configurations. These simulations enable students to visualize key aspects such as voltage and current waveforms, phase relationships, and the effect of compensation capacitors on improving the power factor. The inclusion of three-phase simulations in LTspice adds an advanced layer to the learning process, offering insights into the behaviour of multiphase systems.

This combination of Python-based calculations for single-phase circuits and LTspice simulations for single- and three-phase setups creates a comprehensive educational resource. The approach bridges theoretical learning with practical application, making it easier for students to understand and apply the principles of LR circuits.
